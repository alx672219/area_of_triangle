Given 3 sets of distinct coordinates that form a triangle, determine
the area of the triangle. At least one of the sides will be parallel to
the x or y axis.
<br />
<br />
getTriangleArea has the following parameter(s):
<br />
int x [3]: An integer array that denotes the x coordinates.
<br />
int y [3]: An integer array that denotes the y coordinates, aligned
with Ã— by index.
<br />
Returns:
long int: the area of the triangle
